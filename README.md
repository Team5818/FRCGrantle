_FRC_Gr**ant**le
================

Gradle bootstrap for the FRC ant scripts. Handles setting up the project in a
shared way that allows the native ant scripts to be used, while keeping IDE
files and extra libraries out of the repository.

This is a Gradle plugin that is meant to take over most of the Gradle script customization, for ease-of-setup.
